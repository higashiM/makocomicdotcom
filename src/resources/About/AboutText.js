    <h2>Hello. I am Gareth.</h2>
    <text>
      In 2020, after a 15 year career in finance I decided to take a break and
      learn how to code. I created this website to share my coding journey.{" "}
      {<p />}
      Initially I took a software development course at Northcoders in
      Manchester. Having really enjoyed the course and gained confidence in my
      ability to skills, upon graduation I decided to keep learning. {<p />}I
      chose to focus on game programming in Unity as this afforded me the
      opportunity to be creative and develop tangible end projects as well as
      learn C#. {<p />}
      After completing online courses in 2D and 3D programming I have just
      completed my first Games Jam and soon to release a demo of a 3D squash
      simulator I have been working on. {<p />}Please check out my projects page
      and blog for my latest projects & see the links below for further info and
      contacts. {<p />}Thank you for visiting!{<p />}
